STOLEN,"I was on Lake Road in Lacombe Louisiana, fishing with friends, and some friends of friends who I had not met before, among other random people there. We had a lot of gear, and I wasn't sure if I left it somewhere in our stuff or possibly in my car. It disappeared after that trip, never turned up in any of my stuff, and none of my friends know what happened to it, but I'm pretty certain it's stolen. I have just been using a tablet with wifi since and no use on my sprint plan at all. Thank you.",1.05E+11,Sprint,04-MAY-17 06.21.51.343000000 PM
